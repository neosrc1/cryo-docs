Non-playable characters
=======================
.. line-block:: 
    The term *Non-playable characters* describe any character that is not controlled directly by the player. We broaden this definition to include the *traditional* NPCs, along with :ref:`enemies <enemies>` and non-interactable characters.
    Non-playable characters can serve the purpose of directing the player, notifying them of recent events, delivering story exposition and/or causing direct manipulation of the player's stats.
