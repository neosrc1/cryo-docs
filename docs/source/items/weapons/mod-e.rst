MODFILE (Variant E)
===================
.. line-block:: 
    The MODFILE (Variant E) is a standard-issue ballistic :ref:`weapon <weapons>` that players not opted into the :ref:`Combat class <combat_class>` will receive upon starting their journey.
    It deals lackluster damage, therefore only being viable for weaker :ref:`enemies <enemies>` and as a last resort if your weapons break.
    The player can shoot 20 rounds before needing to reload. The MODFILE (Variant E), being a starter weapon, cannot break or be discarded unless you have a duplicate of it in your inventory.

.. note:: 
    Keep in mind that reloading when ammo is not yet depleted is quicker than reloading on an empty magazine!
