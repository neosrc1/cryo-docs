The O.E.M.
===========
.. line-block:: 
    The O.E.M. (which stands for Ore Extraction Machine) is a standard issue pickaxe :ref:`tool <tools>` that players not opted into the :ref:`Technology class<tech_class>` will recieve when they embark on their journey.
    It extracts ore at a measly rate and cannot mine the majority of available ores, causing it to be superseded by every other ore extraction tool in the game.
    The O.E.M., being a starter tool, cannot break or be discarded unless you have a duplicate of it in your inventory.

.. note:: 
    In a pinch, the O.E.M. will deal more damage to your :ref:`enemies <enemies>` than your bare fists will.
