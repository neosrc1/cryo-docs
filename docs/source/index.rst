=======================================

.. line-block:: 
   **Project Cryocaves** is the development name of a resource management and dungeoneering game based on a world inhabited by animate objects, akin to humans in intelligence and determination.
   It is being actively designed and developed under the lead of neosrc under the guise of the Double Shroom alias.

   The game is planned to be built upon the `Godot <https://godotengine.org>`_ game engine using C#.

   Project Cryocaves is still in its initial design phase. Some details may be ambiguous, incomplete or may not be final.
