Black Vidow
===========

.. line-block:: 

    The Black Vidow (wordplay on "vid-" from "video" and "Black widow"), is an :ref:`enemy <enemies>` that belongs to the :ref:`Earachnid <earachnid>` family.
    It is moderately sized and resembles a VHS cassette tape, complete with typical arachnid features, aside from the large, stylized eyes.
    
    As an enemy, it can take considerably more damage than the smaller :ref:`recluse`, and the damage that it is capable of dealing is not to be underestimated.
    On occasion, the Black Vidow uses a ranged attack, launching its tape towards the player. Getting hit by this attack will most likely cause the player to trip, dealing a fair bit of damage and momentarily stunning them, leaving them vulnerable to regular attacks.
