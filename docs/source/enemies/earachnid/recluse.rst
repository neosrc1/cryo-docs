Recluse
=======
.. line-block:: 

    The Recluse (wordplay on 'record' and 'recluse') is a small :ref:`enemy <enemies>` and is part of the :ref:`Earachnid <earachnid>` family.
    It resembles an old-school shellac record, complete with typical arachnid features, excluding the large, stylized eyes.
    
    As an enemy, it deals unremarkable damage and is easily killed by various influences, however it can be annoying to deal with swarms of Recluses as they hinder the players movement and their damage starts to add up, which poses a threat.
