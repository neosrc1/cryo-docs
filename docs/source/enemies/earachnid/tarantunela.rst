Tarantunela
===========
.. line-block:: 
    The Tarantunela (wordplay on "tune" and "tarantula") is an :ref:`enemy <enemies>` that is part of the :ref:`Earachnid <earachnid>` family.
    It is a formidably large enemy and resembles a subwoofer, complete with typical arachnid features, except for the large, stylized eyes.

    As an enemy, it deals significant damage to the player and poses an immediate threat, especially when other enemies are around.
    Tarantunelas can take a beating, requiring heaps of damage to vanquish them, therefore it is recommended to approach them with a weapon that delivers high and direct damage.
    This enemy makes extensive use of its speaker nature by playing bursts of audio, momentarily stunning the player, similar to the :ref:`black_vidow`. These bursts have impressive range — therefore heightening the importance of a swift kill.

.. note:: 
    If you aren't capable of dealing high damage, try picking off the Tarantunela from a distance — their ability to stun you will be out of reach.
    With some degree of luck, you can cause the Tarantunela to burn out - which prevents it from dazing you any further.
